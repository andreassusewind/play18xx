The game ends when the bank runs out of money. Play until 
the next time a set of operation rounds ends. Keep track of any 
further money paid out on paper.

During phases 3 and 4, a railroad may 
buy a private company
at any time during its turn in an operating round. In addition, 
ownership of private companies may make possible activities 
otherwise not allowed. (See pp. 46-47).

Private companies may be bought by railroad corporations but 
not sold by them. This may not be done until the first 3-train has 
been bought. The price paid may not be less than half or more than 
twice the face value of the company and must be publicly declared. 
This action may be performed at any time during the buying 
corporation’s turn in an operating round

Once the first 6-train is bought, the diesel (“D”) 
trains may be purchased in addition to any 6 trains still in the 
bank. A diesel train costs $1100. But, the price is only $800 if 
the railroad “trades-in” a 4-, 5-, or 6- train. The exchanged train 
(if not obsoleted by the exchange) is placed in the open market.
