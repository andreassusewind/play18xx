During phases 3 and 4, a railroad may 
buy a private company
at any time during its turn in an operating round. In addition, 
ownership of private companies may make possible activities 
otherwise not allowed. (See pp. 46-47).

Private companies may be bought by railroad corporations but 
not sold by them. This may not be done until the first 3-train has 
been bought. The price paid may not be less than half or more than 
twice the face value of the company and must be publicly declared. 
This action may be performed at any time during the buying 
corporation’s turn in an operating round
