During phases 3 and 4, a railroad may 
buy a private company
at any time during its turn in an operating round. In addition, 
ownership of private companies may make possible activities 
otherwise not allowed. (See pp. 46-47).

Private companies may be bought by railroad corporations but 
not sold by them. This may not be done until the first 3-train has

its tokens in its starting city to create its home station (see 7.3.1, p. 20).

During its turn in an operating round, a railroad may place one 
token in a city circle to create a station. This may be in addition to 
the placement of a home station. The following restrictions apply:
